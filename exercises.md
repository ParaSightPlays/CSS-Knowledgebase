### [FlexBox Froggy:](http://flexboxfroggy.com/#gb)

This work of art comes from Codepip, it's a level based game where successfully scripted code advances you to the next level, provided the code moves the little froggsters to their relative lily pad.
This will teach you how to move elements around as a whole and indiviually using the flexbox technique - from the base level properties, to the shorthand technique which can help you clean up your code.

### [Grid Garden:](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

Another beautiful CSS exercise from Codepip, it's a level based game where successfully scripted code advances you to the next level, provided the code waters the carrots and poisons the weeds.
This will teach you how to move elements within a grid and applying style to multiple cells, columns and rows within a grid, as well as altering the dimensions of a grid - from the base level properties, to the shorthand technique which can help you clean up your code.
